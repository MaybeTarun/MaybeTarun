Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tarun Gupta and I'm a second-year BTech student at Bennett University, where I'm specializing in Cloud Computing. My passion for technology and drive to make an impact in the industry have led me to continuously learn and grow. When I'm not hitting the books, I'm working with various clubs on campus, exploring new projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals.

As a technology enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to challenge myself and make a difference. I believe in constantly honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base to stay ahead of the curve.

I'm excited to be a part of the tech community on GitHub and would love to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, professionals, and companies. Let's connect and see how we can help each other grow!
